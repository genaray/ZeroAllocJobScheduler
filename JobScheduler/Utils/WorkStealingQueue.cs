internal class WorkStealingDeque<T>
{
    // This class operates on two fundamental insights:
    //
    //    1. _top never decrements
    //    2. _bottom is only ever modified by the owning process.
    //
    // This means that modifying _bottom is "free," i.e. while pushing/popping to the bottom (our process's "owned half") we
    // don't have to worry about concurrence issues.
    //
    // This also means that when concurrence issues do come up, either with stealing, or with popping from an almost-empty queue,
    // we can always rely on CAS-incrementing _top to tell us whether a race-condition occured.
    //
    // I.e. if our _top is equal to the actual top, we can CAS, and therefore we won the race. Otherwise, someone else (or even multiple
    // others) incremented _top first, and we lost the race, so we give up our operation.
    //
    // Other than that, it's a very standard CircularArray-based Deque, where the top and bottom pointers move around depending on the
    // operation. The owner pushes and pops from the bottom, moving the bottom around wherever, and the stealer pops from the top, exclusively
    // raising the top value and never EVER lowering it.
    //
    // This isn't a complete Deque, because the operation PushTop would force us to decrement Top (which would violate our ability to use CAS
    // to act as a "version" of the top).
    //
    // A valid array can be visualized like this:
    //     t        b
    // [_  x  y  z  _  _]
    // t = _top pointer
    // b = _bottom pointer
    // x, y, z = valid elements in the Deque
    //
    // This array is used as the starting point for all the following operation examples.
    //
    // Pushing a to the bottom looks like this (incrementing bottom to make the queue bigger; ONLY thread-safe from the owning thread):
    //     t           b
    // [_  x  y  z  a  _]
    //
    // Stealing* looks like this (incrementing top to make the queue smaller; thread-safe):
    //        t     b
    // [_  _  y  z  _  _]  => stole x!
    //
    // Popping* z from the bottom looks like this (decrementing bottom to make the queue smaller; ONLY thread-safe from the owning thread):
    //     t     b
    // [_  x  y  _  _  _] => popped z!
    //
    // *These methods might conflict with each other, which is why we check _top in both methods after we do most of the operation to
    // ensure it's still valid.

    // This must be specifically atomically accessed/modified because c# doesn't support volatile longs.
    // Use Volatile.Read/Volatile.Write, which is OK because _bottom is only written from one processor.
    private long _bottom = 0;

    // The same should apply to _top, but it doesn't. I don't know why.
    // The original algorithm uses volatile to read _top and CAS to write _top.
    // However, when we do the same, multiple steal operations accidentally grab the same variable, sometimes.
    // (VERY VERY VERY occasionally. Only really observable through high-stress benchmarks in my experience.)
    // (If you want to test, run on a Debug configuration with new DebugInProcessConfig(), because the already-complete
    // job validation is only run on Debug.)
    // From research, the only difference between Interlocked.Read and Volatile.Read is that Volatile might access
    // a slightly old version of the variable, which our code should be able to deal with since CASTop checks that.
    // But it doesn't work.
    // If anyone has ideas, speak up. This could be caused by...
    //     * A weird edge-case in .NET
    //     * An oversight in the original algorithm (but what?)
    //     * A misunderstanding on my part of how this works
    // Instead, for now, use Interlocked.Read to access _top no matter what.
    // (It's not an issue with the volatile modifier vs. the Volatile class; volatile modifier on ints fails as well)
    // Nhat et al. [2] might have some insight into this, hidden inside the C++ code, but it's far more low-level than
    // we get here, and therefore of limited use.
    private long _top = 0;

    // According to section 2.3, we keep a cache of the last top value, to guess at the size of the Deque
    // so we don't have to look at _top every time.

    // larger-than-life value.
